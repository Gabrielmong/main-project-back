# Backend for main project

This project is developed on Node.js

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies used

### `node index.js`

This starts the server on the port 4000, you can change this on the config.js file


## Database

Using Oracle Databse, you need to install the [Oracle Intant Client](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html) and locate in C:\\oracle\\instantclient_21_6

Open SQL Plus and create a user (VSCODE/ORACLE) and grant required permissions, if having trouble with this, run this command: 
###
    ALTER SESSION SET "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=TRUE;
    
    SELECT PDB_NAME FROM DBA_PDBS; 
    
    ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=[PDB Name]
    
    CREATE USER VSCODE IDENTIFIED BY ORACLE;
    
    GRANT DBA TO VSCODE;

    SHOW PARAMETER SERVICE_NAME; 

And finally open the plugabble database:

###
    ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE [PBD Name] OPEN; 

CREATE A TABLE NAMED "PRUEBA":

###
    CREATE TABLE PRUEBA (
        id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
          name varchar2(50),
          age number(3)
      )
      
 Get you pluggable database name and type it on dbconfig.js
